This code makes a matrix with 100 rows and 100 columns and values between 0 and 10.
The matrix is meant to represent a weighed network with directed ties.

```{r}
#Makin Matrices
dicho<-sample(x=c(0:1),size=10000,replace=TRUE)
net1<-matrix(data=dicho,100,100)
diag(net1)=0
sumnet1<-rowSums(data[net1,1:100])


net2<-matrix(runif(n=10000,min=0,max=10),nrow=100,ncol=100)
diag(net2)=0
```

Now we're going to use this artificial network to test some commands to descriptively
analyse a network. First of all,
