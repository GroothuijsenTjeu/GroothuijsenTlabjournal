<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Theory</h1>
<p>In order to answer the research questions posed in the introduction,
we first turn to previous literature on the subjects of the context of
sociology graduate schools in the Netherlands, patterns in collaboration
in (social) science networks, structural characteristics found in such
networks and potential confounding effects.</p>
<div id="context" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Context</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, sociologists in the Netherlands can
be categorised into two distinct overarching traditions of research,
‘historical sociology’ and ‘explanatory sociology’, both of which have a
graduate school explicitly associated with them, the ASSR and ICS,
respectively <span class="citation">(Haan 2014)</span>. These traditions
and graduate schools are also affiliated with the sociology departments
of specific universities, with ASSR being attached to the University of
Amsterdam, whereas ICS is a collaboration between the departments of the
universities of Groningen, Utrecht and Nijmegen. There are also a number
of smaller graduate schools affiliated with the other universities,
these are often specialised in a specific topic within social science
instead of being more generalist, which ASSR and ICS are.<br />
Going forward, this study will use affiliation with ICS as the
characteristic under investigation, thus distinguishing only between
whether sociologists are or are not affiliated with ICS. This decision
was made primarily based on the availability of data, but is
theoretically justifiable for the following reasons. First of all, three
out of the total seven dedicated sociology departments in the
Netherlands are institutionally affiliated with ICS, in that PhD
candidates at these departments partake in ICS organised courses and are
officially ICS graduates if they finish their PhD <span
class="citation">(ICS 2025)</span>. This also means that ICS affiliated
sociologists looking for a colleague to collaborate with would have
plenty of opportunity to find other ICS affiliates, whereas other
graduate schools are considerably smaller, which makes it more difficult
for their affiliates to find collaboration partners from the same
school. This means that if all graduate schools were accounted for when
studying whether or not sociologists tend to collaborate with others
from the same school, the effect may actually be underestimated simply
because affiliates of the smaller schools have very few opportunities to
form collaborations within their school. A second reason to only
distinguish between ICS and non-ICS is that the theoretical and
methodological preferences of the sociologists making up ICS, which are
a core part of the theoretical mechanisms potentially explaining a
tendency towards intra graduate school collaboration, are more
homogenous than those of sociologists affiliated with the other major
graduate school in sociology, ASSR <span class="citation">(Haan
2014)</span>. This would be cause to expect the tendency to form
collaborations within a graduate school and avoid collaborations with
colleagues from other graduate schools would be most apparent when a
distinction is made between ICS and non-ICS, since ICS affiliates would
generally have more difficulty working with others from a different
graduate school than two sociologists from different non-ICS graduate
schools would have working with each other. With this selection in mind,
we now move on to theoretical mechanisms explaining tendencies of
scientists for associating with similar others, which will be applied to
the graduate school case.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-preferences" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Collaboration
preferences</h2>
<p>Theoretically, the question of whether sociologists prefer to work
with others affiliated with the same graduate school can be approached
from multiple angles, two of which are applied here. On the one hand,
the graduate school could be viewed as a social focus, shared courses
and seminars may make it more likely for two affiliates of the same
graduate school to become aware of each other, thus increasing their
chances of forming a collaboration compared to two sociologists from
different graduate schools. On the other hand, a graduate school can be
considered as instilling certain shared theoretical and methodological
preferences, which would make it easier for two affiliate of the same
school to collaborate in the research because conflicts about the proper
ways to conduct such research are less likely to arise. These two
theoretical approaches are elaborated upon below, but they are treated
as complementary in this study. The goal is not to test which of these
theoretical approaches is a better explanation, it is to ascertain
whether or not sociologists in the Netherlands have a tendency to
collaborate with others from their own graduate school and if this leads
to clustering at the network level. The theory thus serves mainly to
illustrate why these effects could be expected, but this is not a theory
testing study per se. Within the literature on scientific collaboration
networks, an approach based on foci of activity emphasises the way
organisational arrangements influence opportunities for collaboration.
In the case of university departments, it has been found that scientists
are more likely to collaborate with others at their department compared
to collaborating with those outside their department <span
class="citation">(Tobias H. Stark 2020?)</span>. One explanation offered
for this phenomenon is that frequent physical proximity makes it both
easier to work together and more likely to be aware of the possibility
of working together. Departments are thus conceptualised as foci of
activity, since their associated buildings, the coordinated times at
which scientists work there and the other shared activities facilitated
by working within the same organisation increase the chance of two
scientists meeting and allow for easier communication and coordination
during a project, which increases the chance of collaboration <span
class="citation">(Kabo and Owen-Smith 2015)</span>. These reasons for
why working at the same department is conducive to starting research
collaborations can also be applied to graduate schools, though to a
lesser extent. Affiliation with a graduate school such as ICS does not
directly lead the same frequent physical proximity that working at the
same department would. However, especially while studying for a PhD,
candidates would still have some shared courses, which would be taught
by affiliated lecturers <span class="citation">(ICS 2025)</span>. For
this reason, a graduate school could still be considered a focus of
activity.<br />
The other theoretical approach under consideration views a the influence
of being affiliated with the same graduate school on the likelihood to
collaborate more as a matter of preference, with those who have attended
the same graduate school potentially having more intellectual affinity
with one another <span class="citation">(Tobias H. Stark 2020)</span>.
Where is foci of activity approach placed emphasis on opportunities for
tie formation and the ease of maintaining ties with those who share
foci, the intellectual affinity approach turns attention to the
theoretical and methodological preferences of researchers. Having
similar theoretical and methodological preferences is more than a
question of taste, it eases communication because collaboration partners
have a greater proportion of shared language <span
class="citation">(Sameer B. Srivastava 2017)</span> and coordination
through shared criteria for good quality research, which can prevent
disagreements about what methods to use or when a theory is convincingly
argued <span class="citation">(Werner Raub and Gërxhani 2022)</span>.
The link with graduate school affiliation stems from the idea that these
theoretical and methodological preferences are not inherent to people,
but learned. Since the graduate schools are associated with traditions
of research, their students would likely be instilled with the ideas
about what is good sociology that that make up part of these traditions.
An example would be that the explanatory sociology associated with ICS
values a methodological individualist perspective <span
class="citation">(Haan 2014)</span>, which requires that macro level
changes be explained through micro level behaviour. If a sociologist
from outside ICS were to consider a collaboration with an ICS affiliate,
they would then have to weigh whether their own beliefs about
methodological individualism are compatible with those of their
colleague and if this could cause friction in the collaboration. Such
differences in preferences being associated with graduate school
affiliations are another reason to suspect the first hypothesis:</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1: Sociologists affiliated with ICS are more likely to
collaborate with others also affiliated with ICS, and sociologists not
affiliated with ICS are more likely to collaborate with others also not
affiliated with ICS.</p>
</div>
<div id="network-structure" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Network
structure</h2>
<p>Considering these reasons to expect sociologists the have a tendency
to form collaborations with others form the same graduate school, we
move on to the next question: how does this this turn out in aggregate,
at the network level? Previous research suggests that theoretical
fragmentation and mechanisms leading to a tendency to collaborate with
others who share a researchers topics and theoretical preferences would
cause a clustered network <span class="citation">(Moody 2004)</span>.
Since ties would be more likely to be formed and maintained if the two
connected people share such preferences, this would lead to the
formation of clearly distinct groups, with relatively few ties bridging
them. This perspective should also be applicable to graduate school
affiliation, since we argue that preference to work with others from the
same graduate school works partially through similar mechanisms. The
main outcome of interest, however, is not so much whether the
collaboration network conforms to a clustered topology, but rather if
any significant proportion of observed clustering is caused specifically
by the tendency towards intra graduate school collaboration. So the
second hypothesis is formulated as:</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2: Sociologists’ tendency to collaborate with others who
share their (non)affiliation with ICS will cause clustering in the
collaboration network of sociologists at the network level.</p>
</div>
<div id="potential-confounders" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Potential
confounders</h2>
<p>The close association between graduate schools and sociology
departments is cause for caution. The reason is the a confounding effect
of university affiliation may be expected, since a university department
serves as a focus for sociologists to meet and possibly collaborate.
Thus, clustering by grad school on the surface might actually be
clustering by department. A preference for collaborations within the
same university should be accounted for in the analyses to prevent
overestimation of the influence of graduate school affiliation.<br />
Another possible confounding effect is that of seniority since PhD
candidates typically work for tenured supervisors affiliated with the
graduate school the PhD is also affiliated with, the analyses of
sociologists’ hypothesised tendencies to collaborate with others
affiliated with the same graduate school need to ensure that such
supervisory collaborations are not treated as having been caused by a
preference for intra graduate school collaborations.</p>
